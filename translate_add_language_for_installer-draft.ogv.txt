This is a quick&dirty draft, but usable.

Watch first half to see how to create new language for the from-sources-installer.
- copy existing po file e.g. en.po
- mkdir the proper dir for /ua/ based on /en/. Maybe copy there the .mo file too (it will be overwritten next)

Watch from around half - how to translate UA.
- call ./m lui   (or ./menu and find this option there) to do all translations for installer
- or just edit the proper .po file, and then only call ./m lc to recompile language
- start installer with language to test
